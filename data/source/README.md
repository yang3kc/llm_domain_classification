# Source Data

This directory contains the source data files that are used to generate the final data files.

The [dashboard_query_list.csv](dashboard_query_list.csv) file contains the list of domains that were queried for the dashboard.
The list contains 5,653 domains, with their credibility ratings produced by human experts and political leanings (left/right).

The list was generated by merging two existing datasets:

- [Lin et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad286): a list of domains with credibility ratings compiled from multiple sources.
- [DomainDemo](https://github.com/LazerLab/DomainDemo): a list of domains with political leanings (left/right).
